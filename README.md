## mite.enterprise

[mite](http://mite.yo.lk) is a time tracking web app which we use quite a lot at [upstream](http://upstre.am). The problem is that we have a company account and some of our freelancers have their own accounts. When we work on a project together everyone has to go to their account to pull out the reports.

_mite.enterprise_ is a small [node.js](http://nodejs.org) webapp that uses mite's API to pull the reports from the different accounts together into one.
